                    Your satisfaction is our first priority, but we still need to agree to some rules to ensure that there are no misunderstandings about No Spot Laundry's (referred to as "we," "us", or "our") or your obligations during our time together.
                </li>
                <li class="centered first-paragraph-padding blue-faq-q">By using our services you acknowledge and accept the following Terms and Conditions:</li>
                <li class="faq-question first-paragraph-padding">laundering suitability</li>
                <li class="faq-text">
					You agree that your clothes can be washed in <span class="faq-bold">warm water</span>, and dried using <span class="faq-bold">medium heat</span> in a tumble dryer. We cannot be liable for any damage to clothing that is <span class="faq-bold">not suitable for a standard laundering process</span>. We can not examine each individual garment tag before processing the laundry. Therefore, if something is “dry-clean only,” or otherwise unsuitable for common washing and drying techniques, <span class="faq-bold">please do not include it in the laundry you give to us</span>.
				</li>
                <li class="faq-text">
                    We also <span class="faq-bold">reserve the right to decline cleaning</span> any piece of laundry if we think it may <span class="faq-bold">cause damage</span> to our equipment or our staff. This includes <span class="faq-bold">excessively soiled items</span> or items with <span class="faq-bold">biohazards</span> such as <span class="faq-bold">urine, feces, blood,</span> etc.. This also includes laundry from households with known <span class="faq-bold"></span>infections such as <span class="faq-bold">bed bugs</span> or other transmissible pests. This is for the health and safety of our team and our customers.
				</li>
                <li class="faq-question">Payment</li>
				<li class="faq-text">
                    Payment for services is <span class="faq-bold">due at time of service</span>. If you do not want our service, please let u know and we will cancel your wash. Although we truly hope you are satisfied with our services, once we have laundered your clothes, we cannot offer a refund. All new Wash & Fold, Pickup & Delivery and Commercial accounts are set up with credit/debit cards on file for auto-payment and payment will be collected <span class="faq-bold">before laundry is returned</span>.
				</li>
				<li class="faq-text">
					You can send us any amount of laundry you choose, but any loads weighing less than 10 pounds will be rounded up to our minimum weight of 10 pounds. To make life simpler, we round to the nearest pound when weighing your laundry to determine if you have met the required minimum weight (see below). Our weights are final. If you have not met the minimum weight, we will promptly notify you of any surcharge.</li>
                <li class="faq-question">Damaged Laundry</li>
				<li class="faq-text">
                    We do everything we can to <span class="faq-bold"></span>avoid damaging your clothing, but there are things that even we miss. Please check your pockets prior to washing; we can not be responsible if something left in your laundry causes damage to your items. <span class="red">what happens if damage machines?</span> 
				</li>
				<li class="faq-text">
                    All laundering processes cause <span class="faq-bold"></span>normal wear and tear on clothing. As a result, we are not responsible for any wear and tear of laundry, including: loss of buttons, fading, fatiguing,  or abrasions.</li>
                <li class="faq-question">color bleeding</li>
				<li class="faq-text">
                    We sort your laundry in order to provide the best service possible and we use “color catchers” to prevent bleeding of items.  However, we can’t be held responsible for the <span class="faq-bold"></span>re-disposition of colors (aka bleeding) or shrinking / stretching.
				</li>
                <li class="faq-question">Lost Laundry</li>
				<li class="faq-text">
                    We have a very robust tracking system for all orders from the time they are picked up / dropped off to the time they are delivered back to you.  We tag all your bags and loads with your name, and that tag travels with your laundry to ensure all items are returned to you. We also have systems in place to check each work area before and after so that no laundry is left behind.</li>
                <li class="faq-text">    
                    However, <span class="faq-bold"></span>we do not assume any responsibility for missing pieces of laundry.  Because laundry is processed by the load, and not “per item”, we simply have no efficient way of verifying that we received any particular piece of laundry in the first place.
				</li>
				<li class="faq-text">
					If you request that we leave your laundry unattended (e.g., on your porch, in a hallway, or in your foyer) or with a third party (e.g., with a doorman or a neighbor), we are not responsible for your laundry before we have picked it up or after we have dropped it off. You also agree that our records of pick-up and drop-off times are true and accurate.</li>
                <li class="faq-question">Scheduling</li>
				<li class="faq-text">
                    You're free to cancel any appointment up to 1 hour prior to the start of your delivery window, so if you don't have any laundry for us to wash on a particular week, please be sure to notify us more than 1 hour before your appointment time so we don't come to your address and need to charge a no-show fee. We require at least 1 hour's cancelation notice for residential appointments, at least 2 hours notice for commercial appointments.
				</li>
				<li class="faq-text">
					It is possible that we may be late at some point due to unforseeable circumstance, but we do our best to pick-up your laundry at the agreed upon time. Similarly, we hope that you will strive to be on-time for your pick ups and deliveries. If you do miss a pick-up or delivery by more than 10 minutes, we reserve the right to charge a 10$ missed pickup fee. We will try to coordinate an alternate time as soon as possible.</li>
                <li class="faq-question">Allergies</li>
				<li class="faq-text">
					 market this detergent as "hypoallergenic." However, we do wash clothes in shared washing machines where other detergents may have been used, and it is possible that small amounts of other detergents, which may not be hypoallergenic, may not be completely rinsed out of these washing machines.
